# Odin Landing Page Assignment

This assignment was made following the 'Landing Page' assignment on Odin Project, the final part of the HTML/CSS section in Foundations, found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page). The assignment was simply to look at an example image, and, with only some colors, font sizes and weights, recreate it from scratch, with minor or major adjustments to taste, based on all the knowledge we had just learned. So, all of the HTML and CSS in this webpage is entirely made from the ground up, not based on a provided template or anything. The purpose of this is to show that we can create a basic target website without needing guidance outside of a reference. After completing the exercise, I feel that I have met this goal.
